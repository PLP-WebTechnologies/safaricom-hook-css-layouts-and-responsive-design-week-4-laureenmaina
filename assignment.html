      <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
      <p>The image you provided shows a stylized, almost symbolic, depiction of a tree against a dramatic sunset. It's difficult to pinpoint a specific species based on the image alone, as it's likely been artistically enhanced. However, we can make some observations: </p>
       <p>Shape: The tree has a full, rounded crown, suggesting a deciduous tree that spreads its branches widely. This shape is common in many species, such as oak, maple, or ash trees.</p> 
       <p>Silhouette: The image emphasizes the tree's silhouette against the bright sky. This makes it hard to see details like leaf shape or bark texture, which would be crucial for precise identification.</p>
       <p>Context: The tree is positioned on a small hill overlooking water. This environment could suggest a tree that tolerates wind and potentially salty air, like some coastal species.</p>
